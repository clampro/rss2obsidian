# Rss2Obsidian

Rss2Obsidian is a really simple script that uses feedparser to read a list of RSS feeds stored in a text file and store the results in a markdown file in your Obsidian Vault.

This allows you to have some of your favourite news/articles right into Obsidian.

### Installation Instructions

- Rename/Copy rss2obsidian.ini.example to rss2obsidian.ini
- Edit rss2obsidian.ini to point to the note in your vault where you want the results to be written.
- Edit the number of items you want to see for each feed (default 5)
- Edit the rssList.txt to include all the RSS sources you want to watch (I have included two functional and one non functional examples)


### Disclaimer

This script is offered as is. Feel free to do what you want with it :-)
